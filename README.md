# Report Generator
This project, created for a data analysis company, generates reports in Excel that provide insight into the data collected. The data is pulled from an API (omitted in this version for privacy). Three different reports can be generated. The "Current Overview of Spaces" report includes information on the status of devices for different customers. The "Device Report" includes the average, minimum, and maximum values, along with the dates and times of those minimum and maximum values, for each of several analysis and data parameters over a user-specified range of time. The "Monthly Trends" report includes the average value of each parameter for each month of the last year (the user can choose which year to analyze). The user can select which report(s) they would like to generate in an initial pop-up window. The customizations and specifications of the reports are also included in this window.

Note: This program will not run as it has been edited to remove private information. General terms have been put in place of specifics.
